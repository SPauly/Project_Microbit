# Project_Microbit

The following tasks were the preparation for an internship at the Fraunhofer IMS which unfortunately was canceled due to covid. After having left those files alone for about two years I decided to put them on here and maybe work on them once the LSMS Project is finished. Feel free to hit me up for questions, contributions etc. :) 
And yes, I know this project is poorly documented and the code is all over the place... All things that will change once I reopen this project. 

# Task:

- Program a step detection (when the micro:bit is attached to the body or directly to the foot).

- Program a distinction between steps and jumps

- Try to program simple gesture recognition when holding the micro:bit in your hand and writing a gesture in the air: Can they distinguish a horizontal stroke from a vertical stroke, for example. Can they tell if a horizontal stroke is drawn in the air immediately followed by a vertical stroke.

# Task 1 Pedometer:
