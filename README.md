# Task:

- Program a step detection (when the micro:bit is attached to the body or directly to the foot).

- Program a distinction between steps and jumps

- Try to program simple gesture recognition when holding the micro:bit in your hand and writing a gesture in the air: Can they distinguish a horizontal stroke from a vertical stroke, for example. Can they tell if a horizontal stroke is drawn in the air immediately followed by a vertical stroke.
